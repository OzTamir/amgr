# Git Workflow Rules

## Branching
- Create feature branches from main
- Use descriptive branch names: `feat/description`, `fix/description`
- Keep branches short-lived

## Pull Requests
- Write clear PR descriptions
- Link related issues
- Request reviews from relevant team members
- Squash commits when merging

## Code Review
- Review for correctness, not style
- Be constructive and specific
- Approve only when confident
