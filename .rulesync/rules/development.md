# Development Rules

## Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure tests pass before committing
- Prefer unit tests for business logic, integration tests for APIs

## Code Organization
- Follow the project's existing structure
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable code into utilities/helpers

## Debugging
- Use proper debugging tools instead of print statements
- Clean up debug code before committing
- Add meaningful error messages

## Dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained, widely-used packages
- Check for security vulnerabilities before adding dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
